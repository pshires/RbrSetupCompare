# RBR Setup Compare

This is a basic tool for comparing setups in Richard Burns Rally. It has only been tested with the RallySimFans
distribution of RBR, but it should work with any setup using latest NGP physics. Please note that this is a minimal, 
low-effort Rails project and is not intended to showcase best practices or advanced Rails development techniques.

## Check it out
It is [currently being hosted on a free tier of Render](https://rbrsetupcompare.onrender.com). Due to the free tier
hosting, please be aware there may be a 1-2 minute spin-up delay if there has been no recent activity.
